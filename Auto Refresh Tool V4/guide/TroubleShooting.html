		<h2>unexpected crash or program won't start</h2>
		<p>
		The most likley cause of a crash is corrupted perameters. In order to fix
		this open the program folder and run the resetPerameters python file. After
		this try to re-enter the website information and try again. If the issue
		persists it is likely due to incorect input data such as incorrect URL.
		<br>
		<p>
		An unexpected crash could also occur due to mising files. To check that all
		files are present, open the program and confirm the presence of the following
		essencial files:
		<ul>
			<li>configuration tool -python file</li>
			<li>curl              - application</li>
			<li>emails            - text document</li>
			<li>keywords          - text document</li>
			<li>main              - python file</li>
			<li>watchList         - text documet</li>
		</ul>
		If one of thease files are missing, reinstall Auto Refresh Tool.
		</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>
		The crash could possibly be due to a lack of internet connection.

		<h2>Reciving Emails Too Ofen</h2>
		<p>
		This issue is caused by the selected keywords changing constantly between
		website loads. The keyword and website at fult can be identified in the
		"keywords:" section of the email. Remove this keyword by navigating to the
		page for that webpage fromt he main menu and clicking on the red box
		containing this keyword.
		</p>
		<h2>Not Reciving Emails When Webpage Is Updated</h2>
		<p>
		This is most likley caused because the keywords are not applicable for this
		specific page or update. To fix this, more keywods should be added.
		</p>
		<h2>Windows prompts with, "how do you what to open this file"</h2>
		<p>
		This is caused by the inncorrect installation of python. Refer to the installation guaide <a href="Installation.html">here</a>.
