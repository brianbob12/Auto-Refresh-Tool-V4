		<h2>What the tool can do:</h2>
		<br>
		<p>
		The Auto Refresh Tool can inform you as to when a specific webpage within
		a website is updated. The tool checks the webpage once every two seconds for
		changes in keywords. If the tool finds that the website changed, it will
		email you. This can be used to monitor for reports that you are expecting to
		be published or updated. The tool can monitor any number of webpages and can
		email any number of adresses.
		<br><br>
		For example, the webpage below(DG COMP Search) would update when a new
		report is published regarding the search term, "merlin". Howver this specifc
		page will not update if any of the exsisting reports are updated. In order
		to monitor for an update in exsising reports, you must add the support page.
